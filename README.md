Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of the burgers they'd like to eat.


Whenever a user submits a burger's name, this app displays the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.


Each burger in the menu also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger moves to the right side of the page.


This application stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
